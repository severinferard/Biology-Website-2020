                    The <strong>vascular system</strong>, also called the circulatory system, is a network of cylindrical vessels built around the heart which transport blood through the body. It allows the exchange of gas and the distribution of nutrients in all the organs.

                    In vertebrate organisms and some invertebrates, the vascular system is <strong>closed-loop</strong>: the blood is contained in unidirectional vessels linking one organ to another. On the other hand, arthropods such as insects, crustaceans and mollusks, have an <strong>open circulatory system</strong> where the blood is pumped into the hemocoel, a cavity holding the animal’s organs in hemolymph, an interstitial fluid similar to blood. When the animal’s heart beats, the <strong>hemolymph</strong > circulates between the organs in the hemocoel and enters the heart through small openings, the ostia. With the repetition of this movement, the nutrients and gases are exchanged.

                There are three types of vessels: <strong>arteries, veins and capillaries</strong>.
                Arteries carry blood away from the heart toward body tissues. Consequently, they often transport oxygenated blood. They are thick, elastic and located deep in the body to support high blood pressure due to the heart systole. As the arteries move away from the heart, they divide into smaller vessels called arterioles. Veins return mostly deoxygenated blood to the heart. They are thinner than arteries, elastic and can be found closer to the skin. They subdivide into smaller venules. Arteries and veins have a similar structure. The vessel cavity is surrounded by endothelium, a layer of epithelial cells. Then, there is a layer of muscle tissue and a final one of connective tissue.            </div>

                Arteries can carry deoxygenated blood and veins oxygenated one. For example, the pulmonary artery brings deoxygenated blood from the heart to the lungs. Since it moves away from the heart, it is called an artery. Similarly, the pulmonary vein carries the oxygenated blood from the lungs to the heart.

                Blood circulation has a direction determined by <strong>blood pressure</strong>. Indeed, a liquid always moves from regions with a <strong>high pressure</strong> to locations with a <strong>lower one</strong>. When the heart contracts, it creates the biggest pressure of the body and consequently sends the blood towards the arteries. Under the pressure, the membrane of arteries get extended thanks to its elasticity before getting back to its original shape. The progression of blood through these vessels is allowed by this distortion.
                At the end of the arteries, the blood enters capillaries and arteries which small diameter presents a strong <strong>resistance to high blood pressure</strong>. The capillaries network constitute an intermediate between arteries and veins to <strong>decrease blood pressure</strong> so that the veins can support it. <br>Troubles regarding high blood pressure, or hypertension, can lead to cardiovascular diseases. This pathology makes the heart pump harder to send blood to the body. As a result, it may cause hardening and narrowing of the arteries, also known as atherosclerosis.

                Blood flow velocity varies according to the type of vessel. Blood speed is the <strong>lowest in capillaries</strong> because they have a <strong>thinner membrane</strong>, i.e. a smaller cross-sectional area than arteries and vessels. Circular cross-sectional areas can be observed by cutting a blood vessel following a right angle. Moreover, an artery divides into many capillaries so the velocity in the artery decreases when the blood enters the capillaries. The speed rises again when the blood from all the capillaries are added in the vein.        </div>

                Erythrocytes are thinner in the middle of the cell than on the outside: this structure increases the contact surface and allows a <strong>better diffusion of oxygen</strong> through the membrane. Since they do not have any mitochondrium, red blood cells produce their ATP via <strong>anaerobic metabolism</strong>.
                In patients suffering from <strong>sickle cell disease</strong>, hemoglobin (cf. “Transport of gas in the blood” part) has an unusual shape which deforms erythrocytes. They are curved like faucils. This trouble strongly impacts the cardiovascular system, because red blood cells block arterioles and capillaries, stopping the distribution of oxygen and nutrients and the evacuation of carbon dioxide.

                There are 5 main categories of leukocytes, which <strong>fight infections</strong>. Some are phagocytes that absorb microorganisms and dead cells. They can also develop as lymphocytes, involved in immune reactions.
                A healthy human body contains 5 to 10x10<sup>9</sup> leukocytes, but this number increases during infections.
                <strong>Leukemia</strong> is a cancer caused by an accumulation of white blood cells, either through the proliferation of immortal leukocytes or through an overproduction of immature leukocytes.

                    Although <strong>plasma</strong> is mainly composed of water, it has a crucial role in blood circulation. Water acts as a solvent to <strong>dissolve plasmatic proteins</strong> and ions which maintain the osmotic <strong>equilibrium and the pH of the blood</strong>. Some components of plasma are also involved in clotting and immunity (antibodies).
                    To study a specific component of blood, it is possible to isolate it through high-speed centrifugation. Three layers appear according to density: plasma at the top, white blood cells and platelets in the middle, and red blood cells at the bottom.

                Blood cells develop from <strong>hematopoietic stem cells</strong> in the red bone marrow through a process called <strong>hematopoiesis or hemopoiesis</strong>. This phenomenon allows the formation of red blood cells, white blood cells and platelets. These stem cells circulate in the blood and bone marrow of every person no matter their age, but they can also be found in the umbilical cord of babies.
                The bone marrow produces all the red blood cells, all the platelets and 60 to 70 % of the white blood cells, that is the granulocytes. The remaining white blood cells form in the lymphatic tissues such as the thymus, the spleen and lymphatic nodes.

                Oxygen is transported through arterial blood. One of its properties is the ability to dissolve in the blood. However, only 1.5% of the oxygen reaching blood is transported through this means. The remaining oxygen binds to a circulating protein: the <strong>hemoglobin</strong>.

                Four globin proteins form a molecule of hemoglobin. Each globin is bound to a <strong>Fe2+ -containing pigment heme</strong>. One pigment heme can bind to a single oxygen molecule. Consequently, one hemoglobin can carry 4 molecules of oxygen. Since an erythrocyte contains 300 million hemoglobin molecules, it can hold above 1 billion oxygen molecules. <br><br>
    I           n the lungs, hemoglobin gets bound to inhaled oxygen through iron. When the first O<sub>2</sub> binds to one globin, the shape of the three others changes to have a better affinity for O<sub>2</sub>. Once all globins are bound to O<sub>2</sub>, the complex forms an <strong>oxyhemoglobin</strong> also known as <strong>R conformation</strong> (“relaxed”). It is transported in vessels to body tissues where some oxygen molecules are released depending on the need for oxygen of the tissue. When a subunit lets its O<sub>2</sub> go, the complex changes its structure again and is called a <strong>deoxyhemoglobin or T conformation</strong> (“tense”). Since the need for oxygen in tissues is not always high, hemoglobin very rarely releases all its oxygen.

                A few parameters may influence the efficiency of hemoglobin transport such as the pH, influenced by the levels of CO2 (cf. transport of carbon dioxide), and the temperature. Indeed, these two factors change the conformation of proteins, inducing the alteration of their function.
                Some people may have an insufficient amount of available hemoglobin in their blood, leading to tissues lacking oxygen. This condition is known as <strong>anemia</strong>. The main resulting symptoms are fatigue, unusual heartbeat and shortness of breath.
                To assess the oxygenation of tissues, doctors measure the <strong>percent saturation</strong>, which is the percentage of hemoglobin sites occupied by oxygen molecules in the patient’s blood. It is calculated by a device called a pulse oximeter. It sends 2 wavelengths of light (red and blue) through the patient’s finger and measures the light at the exit with a photodetector. The absorption of light by hemoglobin is different regarding its saturation or unsaturation with oxygen. The pulse oximeter readings are presented as a curve of O<sub>2</sub> saturation versus oxygen partial pressure. <strong>The higher the partial pressure of O<sub>2</sub>, the more likely oxygen binds</strong> to hemoglobin. On the contrary, a lower partial pressure of O<sub>2</sub> is more likely to induce its release.
